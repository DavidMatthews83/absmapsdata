# absmapsdata 1.3.2, 2021-11-29
- Adds 2021 Non ABS Structures:
  - `postcode2021`, `lga2021`, `ced2021`, `sed2021`, `tourism2021`, `dz2021`.

# absmapsdata 1.3.1, 2021-10-14
- Fixes some naming issues with `sa1` variables in the `2021` batch.

# absmapsdata 1.3.0, 2021-09-13
- Adds 2021 ASGS standard data (SA1-4, GCC, State and Australia).
- Fixes naming convention error in `sa12011`, `sa22011`, `sa12016`, `sa22016` objects where `sa1_code_201X` and `sa2_code_201X` was *incorrectly* named `saX_main_201X`. This was correct in the data documentation but not the actual variable names. This may cause some issues with backwards-compatibility, for which I am sorry.
